# heroin for Swift

First look at heroin for Swift.

TODO: Add example of `MainContainer` and a class which consumes dependency.
TODO: When asking for dependency, provide Class.self with an optional parameter of a string alias, in the cases where the class has more than one instance but referenced by a different name. The Class.self will be used to determine the property name to query the dependency. This will provide type-safety for 99.9% of the dependencies used within the app.
